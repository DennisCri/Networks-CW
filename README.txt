INSTRUCTIONS:

First build the project using the terminal.
Then compile each class using the terminal javac command.
Now each test class such as CmdLineGet can be run as necessary using commandline commands.



A summary of what I think my TempNode and FullNode can do according to the markscheme:


TemporaryNode.java

• Connect to the 2D#4 network (3) - CAN do this
• Find the full node with the hashID closest to the given hashID (3) - CAN do this
• Store a (key, value) pair correctly handling all responses (3) - CAN do this
• Given a key, find the value from the network (3) - CAN do this

FullNode.java

• Connect to the 2D#4 network and notify other full nodes of your node’s
address (1) - CAN do this
• Accepting incoming connections (3) - CAN do this
• Respond to ECHO? correctly (1) - CANT do this
• Respond to PUT? correctly (3) - CANT do this
• Respond to GET? correctly (3) - CANT do this
• Passive mapping of the network (3) - CANT do this
• Respond to NEAREST? correctly (3) - CANT do this
• Active mapping of the network (3) - CANT do this
